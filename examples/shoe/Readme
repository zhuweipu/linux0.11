Here is a quick hack to get shoelace to work under native
Linux.  All this required was coaxing laceup to compile.
All the executables are provided, so there is nothing to
compile.  I provided laceup.c only in case some adventurous
soul wishes to try adapting shoelace properly someday.

Just follow the readme file provided, and you should be fine.
